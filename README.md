# Dog API Example

## Introduction

This project is meant to expose WEB222 students to a using REST APIs and JSON
data to build dynamic web applications in the browser.

The goal of the project is create a web application that uses the data from the
[Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/), a free REST API of the
[Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

We'll use the Dog API to get dog breed information and images.

## Step 1: Setup

Start by [downloading the code for this project as a `.zip` file](https://github.com/sictweb/dog-api-example/archive/master.zip).

Unzip the file and `cd` into the directory, then install all dependencies:

```
cd dog-api-example
npm install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies in the `node_modules` directory.

## Step 2: Running the Server

After you have installed the dependencies, you can run a web server to
view all the files in the `src` directory:

```
> live-server

Serving "dog-api-example/src" at http://127.0.0.1:8080
Ready for changes
```

You can now open your web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Step 3: Developing the Code

A complete [walkthrough of the code is available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/mtl23RalqLY).

Try following along with the walkthrough, and building the code yourself to practice.

## Step 4: Possible Solution

When you're finished, you can find one possible solution in the [possible-solution branch](https://github.com/sictweb/dog-api-example/tree/possible-solution).

You can also try an online version at [https://sictweb.github.io/dog-api-example/](https://sictweb.github.io/dog-api-example/).
